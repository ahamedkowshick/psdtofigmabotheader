		CSS-botstrap+ style +Media
		Note: 
		1. Don't chnage framework file, always make new think chnages in custom file, namely Media and Style

		2. Custom CSS (Style.css) always writen after the botstrapp CSS
		3. Media.css always lower of serial,such type of CSS run based on screen.

		for developing time we should use botstrap.css(understandable, line by line css) but after delivery to customer(delete botstrap.css file0, we must to enable botstrap.min.css file(this file writen css in single line)


		JSS- botstrap  + Script (if any new think then use plugin)
		Note: write java script always end of the boday tag. this is the standard rules.(due to performance issue(it's called like behaviour))

		Note: ctl+u to check all link are runing from web.
